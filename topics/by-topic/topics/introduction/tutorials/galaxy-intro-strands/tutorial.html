  <p>This tutorial is for those who are new to Galaxy, genomics, and bioinformatics.  If you aren’t new to bioinformatics you can just do the items listed in the Hands-On boxes (<i class="fa fa-pencil" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">hands_on</span>), or you can try one of the <a href="/training-material/topics/introduction/">other introductory tutorials</a>.</p>

  <p>This tutorial teaches the same basic content as <a href="/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-101/tutorial.html">Galaxy 101</a>, but requires less knowledge of biology to understand the questions this tutorial addresses.</p>

<p>To explore this question we need a basic understanding of <em>genomes, chromosomes, strands,</em> and  <em>genes.</em></p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Genome</strong>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The genome is the collection of all DNA native to an organism. For humans, the genome is all of a person’s chromosomes.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Chromosome</strong>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The largest unit of DNA organization in an organism.  Humans have two copies of 23 chromosomes.  Chromosomes are <em>linear</em> in humans, and all animals and plants.  (Bacteria have <em>circular</em> chromosomes.)</p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Strand</strong>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Chromosomes are <em>double-stranded</em>.  One is the forward strand, is typically drawn on top, and moves from left to right. The other, reverse strand, is typically drawn on the bottom and moves from right to left.  Genes can occur on either strand.  A single gene will have parts on only one stand.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Gene</strong>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“What is a gene?” is actually a hotly debated question.  For our purposes, a gene is a section of DNA on chromosome strand that creates a molecule used by an organism.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Graphically, the human genome can be shown as the chromosomes that are in it:</p>

  <p><img src="../../images/human_genome_chroms.png" alt="Human genome consists of 23 (pairs of) chromosomes" /></p>

  <p>And here’s a representation of a chromosome, strands, and genes on the chromosome.</p>

<p>The question we are asking looks like:</p>

<p><img src="../../images/do_genes_on_opposite_strands_ever_overlap.png" alt="Does a situation like this exist?" /></p>

<p><em>Non-overlapping genes are common.  How common are overlapping genes?</em></p>

<h2 id="get-human-gene-definitions">Get human gene definitions</h2>

<p>To answer this question we need to know where genes start and stop on human chromosomes.  That seems like a simple question, but if you are new to bioinformatics it’s actually a hard question to answer.  Web searches will land you at any number of useful places on the web, but without a lot of background knowledge it’s hard to know what you want:  <em>What’s the difference between sequence and annotation?  What are FASTA, BED, GTF, GFF3, and VCF?  What are GRCh37, GRCh38, hg19, and hg38 (and what happened to hg20 through hg37 - are they okay)?</em></p>

<p>It turns out that for this particular question (and for many others), most <strong>Galaxy</strong> instances can help us find this information.</p>

<p>This will take you to the UCSC Table Browser:</p>

<p><img src="../../images/ucsc_table_browser_w_default_settings.png" alt="UCSC table browser tool, first screen for genes" /></p>

<p>The <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables">UCSC Table Browser</a> provides access to all the data that is shown in the <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway">UCSC Genome Browser</a> (see box below). If you are working on a species that UCSC supports (like human) then the Table Browser is a great place to get genomic data.</p>

<p>The Table Browser has a daunting number of options. Fortunately, they are all set to commonly used defaults, greatly simplifying things, and most of the options are already set to what we want:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>clade:</strong> <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mammal</code></li>
  <li><strong>genome:</strong> <code class="highlighter-rouge">Human</code></li>
  <li><strong>assembly:</strong> <code class="highlighter-rouge">Dec. 2013 (GRCh38/hg38)</code></li>
  <li><strong>group:</strong> <code class="highlighter-rouge">Genes and Gene Predictions</code></li>
  <li><strong>track:</strong> <code class="highlighter-rouge">GENCODE v24</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>clade</strong> and <strong>genome</strong> seem pretty clear.  <strong>assembly</strong> asks which version/definition of the human genome we want.  (Any will do for our question, but UCSC is suggesting <code class="highlighter-rouge">hg38</code>, which is also the most recent.)  <strong>group</strong> is set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Genes and Gene Predictions</code> which sounds like what we want. So far so good.</p>

<p><strong>track</strong> has a bewildering list of options. UCSC suggests <code class="highlighter-rouge">GENCODE v24</code>.  A web search leads us to the <a href="https://www.gencodegenes.org/">GENCODE web site</a> which prominently states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The GENCODE project produces high quality reference gene annotation and …</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Time for a few more definitions.</p>

<blockquote class="comment">

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Reference genome</strong>
      <blockquote>
        <p>A reference genome is the <em>genome of a single individual</em> that has been thoroughly studied, to the point that we know exactly what most of that individual’s DNA is.  In practice a reference genome is used as shared map by researchers working on that organism. Reference genomes are updated periodically as techniques improve.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Sequence</strong>
      <blockquote>
        <p>A genome’s sequence describes the DNA in that genome, down to the A, C, T, and G (single nucleotide) level including the exact location where each is.  Given a reference genome, you can ask questions like, “What’s the DNA on chromosome 2 between positions 1,678,901 and 1.688,322?”</p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Genome/Gene annotation</strong>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The sequence tells us what DNA is where, but it doesn’t tell us anything about the function of that DNA.  <em>Annotation</em> is additional information about particular regions of the genome like where genes, repeats, promotors, and centromeres are, or how active a particular gene is.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>track</strong> option asks us which set of annotations do we want to get?  There are so many choices because annotation is the result of analysis and interpretation, and there are many ways to do this. (And in this case, many of the options aren’t even genes or gene predictions.)</p>

<p>GENCODE is “high-quality” and  “gene annotation.” That sounds like a good thing to use.  Lets stay with the default: <code class="highlighter-rouge">GENCODE V24</code>.</p>

<p>So far we haven’t changed <em>anything</em> from the defaults.  Lets change something.  The default  <strong>region</strong> is the whole genome, which can be done, but it’s a lot of information. For this exercise lets use just one (small) chromosome.</p>

<p>This returns us to Galaxy, first displaying a big green box (that’s good!) and then returning us to the view we started with.  Except that we now have an item in our history, the dataset from UCSC.</p>

  <li>The dataset is in <strong>bed</strong> format.  BED is one of several standard formats for representing genome annotation.  BED is a tabular format that we’ll expand on below.  We got BED format because BED was preselected as the output format in the UCSC table browser.</li>
  <li>The dataset’s “database” is <strong>hg38</strong>.  This says which revision of the reference genome this data maps too.  hg38 is the latest human reference genome.  hg38 was also selected by default in UCSC.</li>
  <li>Finally, it shows us the first 5 rows in the dataset.</li>

<h2 id="naming">Naming</h2>

<p>Galaxy allow you to name your analyses (your histories) and your datasets.  We only have one history (“Unnamed history”) and one dataset (“UCSC Main on Human:…”) so far, but it’s a good idea to</p>

<ol>
  <li>Always name your histories</li>
  <li>Name your input and final output datasets, and any significant intermediate datasets.</li>
</ol>

<p>You don’t have to do this.  Galaxy is quite happy for you to have an infinite number of “Unnamed history” histories, and to have all your datasets be obscurely named.  However, once you’ve run your first 5 unnamed analyses, all with obscurely named datasets, you’ll might wish you would have named everything.</p>

<p>You have to know what’s possible, before you can build a plan.  If you don’t have experience with data analysis then you might not have any idea how you would answer our question.  Before we dive in using a particular solution, think about how you might solve this.  If you don’t have any experience with tools, then think about how you might solve it manually, using pencil and paper (it may help to assume you have an infinite supply of helpers to do the pencil and paper work).</p>

<p>Here’s how we’ll answer this question.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Split the genes dataset in two: one for genes on the forward strand, and one for genes on the reverse strand.</li>
  <li>Compare the two datasets to see which ones, if any, overlap.</li>
  <li>Check how many (or what percentage) of our genes overlap with another gene.</li>
</ol>

<p>It turns out that all of these steps are easy in Galaxy.</p>

<h3 id="split-the-genes-into-forward-and-reverse-datasets">Split the genes into forward and reverse datasets</h3>

<p>How might we do this?  Column 6 contains the strand information.  Can we split genes into two datasets based on the value of Column 6.  How?  Lets take a look at our available tools.

<p>It doesn’t say anything about Filter being able to split a file into multiple files.

We would have to run Filter twice, once for forward strand genes, and once for reverse strand genes. Let’s do that.</p>

        <li><strong>Condition</strong>: this free text field is where we specify which records we want in the output dataset.  <em>Enter</em> <code class="highlighter-rouge">c6 == "+"</code> in the text box.
          <ul>
            <li>This specifies that column 6 (the strand) must be equal to (<code class="highlighter-rouge">==</code> is Python for <em>is equal to</em>) a plus sign.</li>

        <p>In Galaxy, a <em>genomic interval</em> is a something that spans part of a chromosome (or some other linear frame of reference like a contig).  Genes are a common example of a genomic interval.  Even a chromosome is a genomic interval, albeit a very long one.</p>

<p>At this point we <em>could</em> say that we have answered our question. Using dataset previews in the history panel, we can compare the number of genes in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Overlapping forward</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Overlapping reverse</code> datasets with the number of genes in the full <code class="highlighter-rouge">Genes</code> dataset, and <em>conclude that overlapping genes on opposite strands are actually pretty common.</em></p>

<p>However, before we rush off to publish our conclusions, let’s</p>

<ol>
  <li>Get both the forward and reverse overlapping genes into a single dataset (one link will look better in our publication), and</li>
  <li><em>Visualize</em> our new dataset, just to double-check our results.</li>

<p>What tool can we use to combine the two datasets into one?

You’ll find lots of tools, but none of them do what we want to do. <em>Some times you just have to manually look through toolboxes to find what you need.</em>  Where should we look?  It’s probably not <strong>Get Data</strong> or <strong>Send Data</strong>, but it could easily be in any of the next 4 toolboxes: <strong>Lift-Over, Collection Operations, Text Manipulation, or Datamash</strong>.</p>

<p>It turns out that <strong>Lift-Over</strong> and <strong>Collection Operations</strong> are not what we want.  (But, take a look at them: if you are going to work with genomic data it won’t take long before you’ll need both.)</p>

<p>Galaxy knows about several visualization options for lots of different dataset types, including BED.  Whenever you preview a dataset in the history panel, Galaxy provides links to these visualizations.  For BED files (which is the format we have), options include <strong>IGB, IGV,</strong> and <strong>UCSC main.</strong>  IGB and IGV are widely used desktop applications and eventually you may want to install one or both of them.  For now, let’s visualize the data at UCSC, using the UCSC <em>Genome</em> Browser.</p>

      <p><em>Genome browsers</em> are software for viewing genomic information graphically.  The <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway">UCSC Genome Browser</a> (and most genome browsers) typically display different types of <em>annotation</em> about a region of a genome.  This is displayed as a stack of <em>tracks</em> and each track contains a different type of information.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Genome browsers are useful for seeing information in context and for seeing (and discovering) correlations between different types of information.  (They are also useful for visually checking results, which is what we are doing now.)</p>

  </ul>

<p>Now, take a look at one of our results.  (Any pair of overlapping genes will do.)  Our data is in the second to top track (<strong>User Track / User Supplied Track</strong>). That track shows a line of small black boxes, sometimes connected with a line.</p>

    </li>
    <li>A window pops up describing several ways to interact with the browser.  Just <em>click</em> the <strong>Zoom In</strong> button at the bottom.</li>
    <li>This redraws the window, this time zoomed in to what you highlighted.</li>
    <li>Continue to zoom in until you have the set of linked black boxes you picked centered on the screen.</li>
    <li>Once you are as zoomed as you want to be, click on one of the linked boxes.  This will expand the track:

      </blockquote>
    </li>

<p>The black boxes connected by lines represent genes, and each set of connected boxes is a single gene (actually, a single transcript of a gene).  Take a close look at the top several tracks.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It looks like we preserved the gene definitions just fine.</li>
  <li>It looks like, sure enough, there are overlapping genes here, and they are on opposite sides.  The arrows on the connecting lines tell us which strand the gene is on.</li>
</ul>

<p>Um, <em>what’s up with the boxes and the lines connecting them?</em></p>

    <li><strong>Exon</strong>
      <blockquote>
        <p>In humans (and in all plants and animals) the molecules that are built from genes are often only built from a part of the DNA in the gene. The sections of DNA that can produce the molecules are called <em>exons</em>.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>As you may have guessed (or already knew): The black boxes are exons.  <em>Genes</em> are defined as <em>covering the entire area from the first black box to the last connected black box.</em></p>

<h2 id="do-we-have-a-problem">Do we have a problem?</h2>

<p><em>Maybe.</em></p>

<p>Our <em>ad hoc</em> review of identified overlapping genes in the UCSC Genome Browser has <em>(or should have!)</em> confirmed that every gene we said has an overlapping gene on the opposite strand does in fact have that.  So, our conclusion appears solid: A significant percentage of genes <em>do</em> overlap with other genes on the opposite strand.</p>

<p>But, our conclusion may not be as <em>significant</em> as we had hoped. If only parts of genes, the exons, make stuff in our bodies, then should we have run this analysis on just the exons rather then the entire genes?  Probably.</p>

<p>Let’s refine our question slightly</p>

<h3 id="so-i-have-to-do-this-all-over-again-but-with-exons">So, I have to do this all over again, but with exons?</h3>

<p><em>Well, yes and no.</em>  We will have to run the analysis again, this time on exons instead of whole genes. But we won’t have to manually recreate every step of our analysis. Galaxy enables us to create a reusable <em>workflow</em> from the analysis we just did, and then we can rerun the analysis, as one step, anytime we want to, and on any dataset.</p>

<h2 id="rerun-analysis-with-exon-data">Rerun analysis with exon data</h2>

<p>We want to run the same analysis, but this time only look for overlaps that happen in <em>exons</em>, the parts of genes that produce stuff our body uses.  Before we start looking at exons, let’s start a new history, one that contains only the genes file we got from UCSC. We could go back to UCSC and refetch the file, but there is an easier way.</p>

    <li>The history name is a link.  <em>Click</em> on it.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="get-the-exon-data">Get the exon data</h3>

<p>And your new history appears in the history panel with the copied <em>genes</em> dataset.  What we need is <em>exons.</em> How can we get the exon information?  There are two relatively easy ways to get this information, one of which will be very familiar.</p>

<p>The first method involves going back to the UCSC Table Browser.  Everything on the first form would stay the same: We still want human, hg38, GENCODE v24, and just <code class="highlighter-rouge">chr22</code>. The second form is what changes.  Instead of getting the <strong>Whole Gene</strong>, we need to retrieve the <strong>Coding Exons</strong> only.</p>

<p>The second method is to use the <strong>Gene BED To Exon/Intron/Codon BED expander</strong> tool in the <strong>Operate on Genomic Intervals</strong> toolbox to extract the exon information from the genes BED file we already have. (<em>Of course!</em> you say.  Umm, there is no way that you should have known that you already had this information in the genes file, or that this tool existed.)</p>

<blockquote class="notranslate hands_on">
  <h3 id="hands_on-get-the-exon-data"><i class="fa fa-pencil" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">hands_on</span> Get the exon data</h3>

    <li>Get the exon information, either by revisiting UCSC, or by using the <strong>Gene BED To Exon/Intron/Codon BED expander</strong> tool.  If you use the expander tool select <strong>Coding Exons only</strong> from the <strong>Extract</strong> pull-down.</li>
    <li>Give the resulting dataset a meaningful name.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>If you got the data from UCSC it will look something like this:
<img src="../../images/101_exons.png" alt="Contents of the exons dataset from UCSC" /></p>

<p>Your history should now have two datasets: one describing entire genes, and one describing just the exons.</p>

<h3 id="rerun-the-analysis-this-time-on-exons">Rerun the analysis, this time on exons.</h3>

<p>When you did the <em>History to Workflow</em> tutorial you created a new workflow that was then added to your list of defined workflows.</p>

<blockquote class="notranslate hands_on">
  <h3 id="hands_on-run-the-workflow-on-the-exon-data"><i class="fa fa-pencil" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">hands_on</span> Run the workflow on the exon data.</h3>

  <ol>
    <li><em>Click</em> the <strong>Workflow</strong> tab in the menu at the top of the Galaxy page.
      <ul>
        <li>This lists all of your defined workflows, including the one you just created.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><em>Click</em> on the newly created workflow and select <strong>Run</strong> from the pull-down menu.
      <ul>
        <li>This launches the workflow run form (which you also saw when testing this workflow)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><em>Select</em> <strong>No</strong> under <strong>Send results to a new history</strong></li>
    <li><em>Set</em> the first (and only) input dataset to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Exons</code> dataset, using the pull-down menu.</li>
    <li><em>Click</em> the <strong>Run workflow</strong> button.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>And Galaxy launches the workflow and says (in a nice big green box) something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can check the status of queued jobs and view the resulting data by refreshing the History pane.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which in this case <em>is the truth</em>.  You can refresh the history panel by either reloading the whole page, of by clicking the looping arrow icon at the top of the history panel.  What you’ll see is a stack of history steps that will go from queued to running to done as you watch them.</p>

<p>All steps in the history will be green when the workflow is done. Once that happens compare your output dataset with your input dataset?  What percentage of exons overlap with other exons on the opposite strand, and is it common or rare?  Is it a smaller percentage than we saw for whole genes?</p>

<h2 id="are-we-done">Are we done?</h2>

<p>Probably.  Note that we can no longer say what percentage of <em>genes</em> overlap.  We <em>can</em> say what percentage of exons overlap, and that is probably close enough for our goals.  If it isn’t and we actually need to say what percentage of genes overlap, then we will have to do some extra work.  This can be done is several ways, but the Galaxy 101 tutorial may give you some ideas on how to follow this question all the way to genes.</p>

<h2 id="why-not-use-excel-for-this">Why not use Excel for this?</h2>

<p>You could use Excel or another spreadsheet program to do this analysis.  Here, we learned how to use Galaxy by answering a question.  You could just as easily learn Excel by answering the same question, and if the goal is to learn how to use a tool, then either tool would be great. But what if you are working on a question where your analysis matters?  Maybe you are working with human clinical data trying to diagnose a set of symptoms, or you are working on research that will eventually be published and maybe earn you a Nobel Prize?</p>

<p>In these cases your analysis, <em>and the ability to reproduce it exactly</em>, is vitally important, and Excel won’t help you here. It doesn’t track changes and it offers very little insight to others on how you got from your initial data to your conclusions.</p>

<p>Galaxy, on the other hand, <em>automatically records every step of your analysis.</em>  And when you are done, you can share your analysis with anyone.  You can even include a link to it in a paper (or your acceptance speech).  In addition, you can create a reusable workflow from your analysis that others (or yourself) can use on other datasets.</p>

<p>Another challenge with spreadsheet programs is that they don’t scale to support <em>next generation sequencing (NGS)</em> datasets, a common type of data in genomics, and which often reach gigabytes or even terabytes in size.</p>
